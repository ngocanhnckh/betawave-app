## Why BetaWave?

Research shows that **40Hz beta waves** can significantly improve concentration, memory, and cognitive performance. Many people listen to beta wave tracks on YouTube, but these come pre-mixed with music that may not suit everyone's taste.

**BetaWave solves this problem.** Instead of forcing you to listen to someone else's music choice, BetaWave plays pure 40Hz binaural beats at a low volume (default 5%) that you can mix with your own favorite music. Put on your preferred playlist, start BetaWave, and enjoy the cognitive benefits of beta waves while listening to music you actually love.
